## Global Components for each ESP32 Sub-project

The files in this directory allow us to create reusable components for use in all of the esp-idf sub-projects.

## Attribution and Origin

This component is based on the original implementation provided by the **[ESP32-CSI-Tool](https://github.com/StevenMHernandez/ESP32-CSI-Tool)** repository, developed by Steven M. Hernandez. 

It has been integrated into the **LILO** (Locked-In Left-Out) project as the fundamental layer for Channel State Information (CSI) data acquisition. The tool's core logic for CSI initialization and packet capturing remains consistent with the original repository to ensure compatibility with standard CSI processing workflows.

*This integration is part of an Engineering Thesis project at the **AGH University of Krakow**.*
